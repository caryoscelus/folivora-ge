===========

Yet another 2d game engine/framework in early development.

This one is written in haskell using frp library netwire. Hopefully, it will
eventually become a proper framework (demonstrating superiority of frp and
functional programming in general), but now it's just a small library with
features being added when i need them for some game project and architecture
being improved after the code is working (it was started as making snake game
using netwire)..

If that haven't scared you out of trying to use it, feel free to ask questions
about it. Eventually there will be proper documentation, but if nobody is
interested, it has very low priority atm.

Building
--------

If you're familiar with cabal, building is trivial except you'll need this:
https://github.com/caryoscelus/graphics (also buildable with cabal)

Demos
-----

Some demos are included and will be built by default.
